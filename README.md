Tallybook is an iOS app to keep track of things you do every day. I'm a numbers guy, and before I designed Tallybook, I was keeping track of things (like whether I went to the gym, for example) in a spreadsheet. I didn't like the experience of having to mess with a spreadsheet from my phone, so I decided to create Tallybook. Tallybook is designed to help users track day-to-day data with as few interactions as possible: open the app, press a button, close the app. Tallybook also has historical editing functionality and a statistics screen for each thing you're tracking.
